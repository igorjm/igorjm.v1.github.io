                <div class="bio">
                    <p>My name is Igor José Melo. I am 21 years old and I am living in Florianópolis/SC, Brazil.</p>
                    <p>I am currently working as a Software Developer at netPACS. netPACS is a software company focused on the development of Radiological Systems.</p>
                    <p>I started to get involved with development and tech in 2013, right after I finished High School. The first programming language that I started to learn was Python</p>
                    <p>But then I switched to Java because it was the programming language that was used in my programming classes in college.</p>
                    <p>As soon as I got into college, I got my first internship as an IT in a radiology clinic. Afeter almost 2 years working as IT in the clinic, I was called to work on a startup as a Software Developer.</p>
                    <p>This startup, was netPACS, previously presented. And I am still working there. Thanks to the company, I have acquired a lot of knowledge in software programming, organization, processes and software methodologies</p>
                    <p>So this is a little bit of my history. I am still young and motivated, and all of this is just the beginning  of my history, I hope you enjoyed it.</p>
